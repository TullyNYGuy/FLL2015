# FLL2015
NeXT Generation FLL 5787 2015-16 EV3 code
The code here is our development respository for the Trash Trek season. 
Note that the code is not ascii and so conflict resolution will not work. 
But it does provide a backup location and point in time snapshots which are
available through Atlassian SourceTree.
